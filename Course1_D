In this module, I learned how to initialize a Git repository and manage versions of my code efficiently.  
I now understand the importance of staging, committing, and creating branches to organize different features.  
The hands-on experience with commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git branch` gave me a solid foundation in version control.  
I also learned how to collaborate using remote repositories with GitHub.
